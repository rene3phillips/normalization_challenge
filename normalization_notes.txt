ORIGINAL, UNNORMALIZED DESIGN:
All the data was stored in a single table which led to data redundancy. 
For example, the same author and email appeared multiple times for each book they wrote. 

STEPS TAKEN TO REACH 3NF:
1NF: Split the original table into seperate tables to eliminate redundancy in rows.
2NF: Removed partial dependencies by placing author information in a seperate Authors Table.
3NF: Removed transitive dependencies by ensuring author details are only in the Authors Table.

WHY THE JOIN TABLE WAS NEEDED:
The join table prevents redundancy, which wouldn't be possible with just the two original tables 
(the books and categories tables).
